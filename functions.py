# Create Functions Practice #2
# Declare a function called welcome, which takes a person's name as an argument, and every time it is called, it prints "Welcome {name}!"

# Create the variable name, and store any name inside of it, so we can test the function with a name of your choosing.

# You should only define the function and create the variable, you should not call the function afterwards.

# Create Functions Practice #3
# Declare a function called square, that takes any number as an argument, and each time it is called, it prints the square of that number on the screen (that is, the value to the second power).
